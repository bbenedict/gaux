BIAS EXAMPLE

This code demonstrates a methodology for detecting bias in text produced by
Large Language Models (LLM). Bias detection is an important part of the
GAUX standard.

Two models are downloaded from HuggingFace.co. Each model produces a bias
score and the best score is selected as the final score. Different
models detect different types of bias.  Therefore, we consider the text
biased if either model detects bias.
